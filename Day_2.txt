doc vs window object

the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
                                                    Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window.

window: is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript
   document: contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML
